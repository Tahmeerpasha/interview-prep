// VAR, LET & CONST Interview Questions

// Question 1 : Variable Shadowing
//  In JavaScript, variable shadowing occurs when a variable with the same name as a variable in a higher scope is declared in a lower scope.
// It's a common practice but can lead to confusion if not used carefully because the inner variable will "shadow" the outer variable.
// In first example, let a inside the if block shadows the outer let a, and they are two separate variables despite having the same name.
function test() {
  let a = "Hello";

  if (true) {
    let a = "Hello"; // New value assigned
    console.log(a);
  }

  console.log(a);
}

test();

// Question 2 :  Illegal Shadowing
/* 
-This occurs when trying to shadow a variable using var within the same scope where that variable is already defined using let or const.
-In second example, var b = "Bye"; is illegal shadowing because b is already declared using let in the same scope.
*/
function func() {
  var a = "Hello";
  let b = "Namaste";

  if (true) {
    let a = "Hi"; // Legal Shadowing
    var b = "Bye"; // Illegal Shadowing
    console.log(a); // It will print 'GeeksforGeeks'
    console.log(b); // It will print error
  }
}
test();

// Question 3 : Hoisting
/*
-In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
-However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or assignments.
-In third example, console.log(a); will result in undefined because the variable a is hoisted to the top but not initialized until later in the code (var a = 10;). 
*/
console.log(a);

var a = 10;

// Question 4 : Temporal Dead Zone
/*
-TDZ is a specific behavior related to variables declared using let and const. It refers to the period between the start of the block scope and the actual declaration of the variable.
-During the TDZ, accessing the variable will result in a ReferenceError.
-In fourth example, trying to log a, b, and c before their respective declarations will result in ReferenceError because they are in the TDZ until they are declared.
*/
console.log(a, b, c);

const c = 30;
let b = 20;
var a = 10;
